          Verse 4: KR$NA] <br /> Aya me kahan se, Dekho pahauncha me kahan pe,
          <br /> KR$NA ke naam pe chaudi yahan puri awaam hai <br />
          Mile dua ke naam pe, dhuaan ye jaante
          <br /> Kyun aaj ye kampte? dikhe saanmp inhe kue me jhaank ke <br />
          Pure ek saans me karoo me to asli kaand
          <br />
          Jalti jaan inki dekh ke mera asli kaam <br />
          Jaldi baand ye naqab jaise badrinath me Rajnikanth, I'm Rajnikant

          10 plus years been underrated as fuck Always kept it a buck, I never
          ducked no action
          <br />
          Thought they'd be chuffed and celebrating my ups
          <br /> But they're claiming it's luck and never praising my passion
          <br />
          I'm a savage in both languages, kinda tight with the rap but it's no
          bandages <br />
          Brandishing flows that are so damaging, throw hands with it, when the
          beat bang
          <br />
          My fangs come out and I strangle it Jaan te baat sab - meri baatein
          vastav

          Kahan se kaha tak dekhe mene raaste ghaatak <br /> Rap ke waste karte
          ye khaas se nataak <br />
          Paas the khaas tab wahi mere paas hai aaj tak
          <br /> Never lacking the energy making my enemy's scared of me
          <br />
          Cleverly put 'em in jeopardy chopping the melody - guillotine I'm a
          remedy, mentally, for the ones that need therapy

          achieved? reach
          <br /> In the name of KR$NA girls are here like wildfire <br />
          Instead of prayers you get smoke
          <br /> Why are they shivering today? You'll see snakes when you peek
          into the wells
          <br />
          I do a true scam to you in one breathe
